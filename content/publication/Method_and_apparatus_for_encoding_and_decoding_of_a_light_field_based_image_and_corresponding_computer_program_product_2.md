abstract = "The present disclosure generally relates to a method for predicting at least one block of pixels of a view (170) belonging to a matrix of views (17) obtained from light-field data belong with a scene, According to present disclosure, the method is implemented by a processor and comprises for at least one pixel to predict of said block of pixels: - from said matrix of views (17), obtaining (51) at least one epipolar plane image (EPI) belong with said at least one pixel to predict, - among a set of bidirectional prediction modes, determining (52) at least one optimal bidirectional prediction mode from a set of previous reconstructed pixels neighbouring said at least one pixel to predict in said at least one epipolar plane image, - extrapolating (53) a prediction value of said at least one pixel to predict by using said at least one optimal bidirectional prediction mode."
