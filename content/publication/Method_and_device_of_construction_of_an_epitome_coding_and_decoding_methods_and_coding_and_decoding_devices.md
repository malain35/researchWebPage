The method comprises at least one iteration of: - determining (120) for each of at least two patches the number of blocks of said image reconstructed by an extended epitome formed by a current epitome and the patch, wherein a block is reconstructed by the extended epitome when a distance between the block and a weighted linear combination of patches of the extended epitome is below a threshold value; - adding (122) to the current epitome the patch, among the at least two patches, that reconstructs the highest number of blocks."
