abstract = "The invention relates to a method for predicting a pixel block of an image using a weighted sum of pixel blocks belonging to patches of a dictionary ( D l ) from a set of candidate patches (PS), each patch being formed of a pixel block of an image and a causal neighbourhood of this pixel block. The method is characterised in that a subset of candidate patches (SPS) is obtained from the set of candidate patches (PS) and the dictionary ( D l ) is formed of a patch of the subset of candidate patches (SPS), called the first patch, and at least one other patch of said set of candidate patches (PS), called the second patch."
