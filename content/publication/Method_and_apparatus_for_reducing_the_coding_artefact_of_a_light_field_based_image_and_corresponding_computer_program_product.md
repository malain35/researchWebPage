abstract = "The present disclosure generally relates to a method for reducing the coding artefact of at least one pixel of a view (170) belonging to a matrix of views (17) obtained from light‐field data associated with a scene. According to present disclosure, the method is implemented by a processor and comprises for each said at least one pixel: ‐ from said matrix of views (17), obtaining (51) at least one epipolar plane image (EPI) associated with said pixel, ‐ applying (52) an artefact filtering on pixels of said epipolar plane image (EPI), ‐ redistributing (53) the filtered pixels of the epipolar plane image in the matrix of views (17)."
