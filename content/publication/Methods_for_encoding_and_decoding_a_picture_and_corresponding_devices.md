abstract = "A method for decoding a picture divided into blocks is disclosed. The method comprises at least one iteration of: a) determining (S20) for at least two blocks adjacent to a reconstructed part of the picture a priority level responsive at least to directional gradients computed in a causal neighborhood of said block; and b) decoding (S22) a part of the picture comprising the block whose priority level is the highest."
