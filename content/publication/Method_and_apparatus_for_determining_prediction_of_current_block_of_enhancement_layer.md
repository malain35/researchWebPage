abstract = "A method (700) for determining a prediction of a current block of an enhancement layer dedicated to a high dynamic range coding is provided. In the method, a coding mode capable of encoding the prediction of the current block is obtained (S705). Next, a first block of prediction including neighboring pixels of the collocated block is determined (S710), and a first intermediate patch of the low dynamic range is built (S715). Then, a second block of prediction including neighboring pixels of the current block is determined (S720, and a second intermediate patch of the high dynamic range is built (S725). Then, a transfer function is determined (S730) to transform the first intermediate patch to the second intermediate patch in a transform domain, a patch is built (S735) by applying the transfer function to a transformed initial patch of the base layer in a transform domain and then applying an inverse transform to the resulting patch so as to return in a pixel domain and the prediction of the current block of the enhancement layer is obtained (S740) by extracting a block from the patch. The extracted block in the patch is collocated to the current block of the enhancement layer in the second intermediate patch."
