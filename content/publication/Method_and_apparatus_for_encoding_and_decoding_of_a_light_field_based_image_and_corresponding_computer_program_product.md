abstract = "The present disclosure generally relates to a method for predicting at least one block of pixels of a view (170) belonging to a matrix of views (17) obtained from light-field data belong with a scene. According to present disclosure, the method is implemented by a processor and comprises for at least one pixel to predict of said block of pixels: ‐ from said matrix of views (17), obtaining (51) at least one epipolar plane image (EPI) belong with said pixel to predict, ‐ among a set of unidirectional prediction modes, determining (52) at least one optimal unidirectional prediction mode from a set of previous reconstructed pixels neighboring said pixel to predict in said at least one epipolar plane image, ‐ extrapolating (53) a prediction value of said pixel to predict by using said at least one optimal unidirectional prediction mode."
