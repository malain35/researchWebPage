abstract = "Image prediction methods based on data dimensionality reduction techniques have been recently introduced for still images. These techniques have been proven efficient, especially when used in a H.264 framework. This paper introduces a natural extension of this work from spatial prediction to temporal prediction. Locally Linear Embedding and Optimized Map-Aided Locally Linear Embedding methods are adapted within H.264 in order to improve inter image prediction. The resulting prediction methods are compared with the H.264 motion estimation/compensation method, template matching methods and Adaptive Interpolation Filters, and are shown to bring significant Rate-Distortion performance improvements (up to 20.21 % rate saving with respect to H.264)."
