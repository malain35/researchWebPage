[SAUCE](https://www.sauceproject.eu/) was a three-year EU Research and Innovation project between Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Foundry, DNEG, Brno University of Technology, Filmakademie Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Saarland University, Trinity College Dublin, Disney Research to create a step-change in allowing creative industry companies to re-use existing digital assets for future productions.

The goal of SAUCE was to produce, pilot and demonstrate a set of professional tools and techniques that reduce the costs for the production of enhanced digital content for the creative industries by increasing the potential for re-purposing and re-use of content as well as providing significantly improved technologies for digital content production and management.

The project ran from January 1st 2018 to 31st December 2020.
