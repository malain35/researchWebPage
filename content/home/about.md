# Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [V-SENSE project]({{< relref "project/V-SENSE.md" >}}) at the [School of Computer Science and Statistics](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/) in Trinity College Dublin.
I received the Master's degree in electrical engineering from the Bordeaux Graduate School of Engineering ([ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/en)), Bordeaux, France in 2012 and the PhD degree in signal processing and telecommunications from University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France in 2016.
As a PhD student working in [Technicolor](http://www.technicolor.com/) and [INRIA](https://www.irisa.fr/temics/demos/) in Rennes, France, I explored novel image and video compression algorithms.
My research interests lie at the intersection of signal and image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics.
My current research topic involves light field imaging, with a focus on denoising, super-resolution, compression, scene reconstruction, and rendering.
